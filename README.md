MARTIAL ARTS HOUSE

This is the main website for Martial Arts House. It is designed to be responsible and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and members.

Design

Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are red, black and white.

Typography

The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Droid Serif and Roboto as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to stand out and attract the user's interest. It also has a dynamic and fierce aesthetic as it is meant to encourage and awaken an interest for martial arts.
