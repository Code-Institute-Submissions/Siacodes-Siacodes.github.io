MARTIAL ARTS HOUSE

View the live website here: https://siacodes.github.io/ 

This is the main website for Martial Arts House. It is designed to be responsible and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and members.

Design

- Colour Scheme
    - The two main colours used are red, black and white.
- Typography
    - The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Droid Serif and Roboto as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
- Imagery
    - Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

Features

- Responsive on all device sizes.
